Explore open jobs We make creative tools to help people grow their businesses . We help teams get the best data foundation possible to reach their best-fit customers. We care about helping people grow businesses: whether taking a solo dream to a small team or scaling a mature enterprise company. Growing a business means finding and reaching customers who need your product. That requires deep research which, historically, demanded huge investments in tooling, money, and manual labor. We help combine 1st-party data, intent data, and 3rd party data from 100+ external enrichment in one place for people to do deep customer research. With Clay, a single person can run growth campaigns that previously required coordinating the entire GTM team. This means companies can send fewer, better messages—and only to people who are a good mutual fit. Sales representatives can focus on nurturing customer relationships and closing deals. The Clay crew Who we are We're a kind, creative team with quiet egos. We believe in helping each other grow in every sense of the world: as people, creatives, professionals, and more.
