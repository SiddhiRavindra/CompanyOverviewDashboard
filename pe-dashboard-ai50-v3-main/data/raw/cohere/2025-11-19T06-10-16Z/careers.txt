Work life at Cohere is flexible, collaborative, and built on trust. We have offices in London, Paris, New York, San Francisco, Toronto, Montreal, and Seoul, but you can work from wherever you’re most productive. Every employee receives a workplace stipend to create a setup that suits them best, and team members in cities without a Cohere office can use our coworking benefit to stay connected and supported. How does Cohere support professional development? We offer a $2,000 annual allowance for learning and education. You can put this towards attending conferences, taking courses, language lessons, or leadership coaching. What should I expect from Cohere’s interviewing process? We aim to keep our interview process clear, respectful, and collaborative. It’s designed to give you a chance to show your strengths and meet the people you’d be working with. The process starts with an application review, followed by a conversation with a recruiter. From there, you may be asked to complete a take-home assignment, meet with the hiring manager, and then connect with a few team members in your final round of interviews. If everything aligns, we’ll move forward with an offer. We’re happy to conduct interviews via video conference and to break up sessions to a schedule that suits you (whenever possible).
