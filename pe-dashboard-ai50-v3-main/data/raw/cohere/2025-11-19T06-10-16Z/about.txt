Our Mission We believe AI’s highest purpose is to enhance human wellbeing. We’re committed to realizing that potential by empowering businesses to scale innovation, boost productivity, and drive progress that reaches everyone. Our story From Toronto startup to enterprise AI 2019 Foundations Cohere was founded in 2019 in Toronto with a bold vision: to do whatever it takes to scale intelligence to serve humanity. Since then, we’ve remained focused on building enterprise AI that enhances human judgment, accelerates execution, and extends what individuals and teams can achieve on their own. 2021 – 2024 Early growth Between 2021 and 2024, we secured four major funding rounds (Series A through D), raising nearly $1 billion. This support has enabled us to scale our teams, expand globally, and continually develop cutting-edge models that power practical AI applications for the world’s leading enterprises. 2022 Research focus In 2022, we launched Cohere Labs, our open science initiative for solving complex machine learning problems. Today, Cohere Labs has 4,500+ community members and has published over 100 research papers.

North’s agentic capabilities and advanced retrieval allow teams to automate routine tasks, accelerate complex workflows, and surface insights securely grounded in enterprise data.
