Careers | Sierra Skip to main content Hi, we're Sierra. We'd love for you to join us. Discover your next job at Sierra. Open roles At Sierra, we're helping businesses build better, more human experiences with AI. Our team works at the forefront of AI, combining research with a focus on real-world impact. That blend of innovation and practicality drives everything we do, and we’re always on the lookout for thoughtful, mission-driven people. In-person, in-office culture We're headquartered in San Francisco, with growing offices in Atlanta, New York, and London, and spend most of our time collaborating in person. We believe working side by side helps us move faster, solve harder problems, and build stronger relationships. That said, we trust you to work from home when life or focus demands it. Family-first benefits Sierra is committed to supporting teammates in all aspects of life. We offer top-tier health and life insurance, a 401(k) with company match, generous parental leave, fertility benefits, and flexible time off—so you can prioritize what matters most. Personalized perks Rather than predefined perks like gym memberships, we offer an annual stipend you can use toward whatever makes your work life better—whether that’s a new monitor, childcare, or a phone plan. A passionate, diverse team We’re a passionate, mission-driven team that values diversity of thought, background, and experience. We actively seek out exceptional people who bring unique perspectives—because we believe that’s how the best products, cultures, and companies are built. The Early Career Program As an early career team member at Sierra, you’ll work directly with customers to build AI agents for leading global brands, gaining mentorship and real-world experience from day one. If you want to shape the most important technological wave of our time and grow alongside top talent, come build at Sierra.
