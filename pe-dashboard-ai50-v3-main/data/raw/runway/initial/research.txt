I could quickly build out all the specific formulas I had been dying to build out beforeâwithout having to spend 50+ hours a week in spreadsheets. â Derek Ou-Ponticelli CFO at AngelList â Itâs about more than just saving time. With Runway, spotting trends is easierânow we can more efficiently tell stakeholders what number a metricâs going to be and why. â Amanda Hoppe CFO at indie.io â I am in Runway every day. Thatâs where I get my information. Thatâs where I plug in everything I learn from meetingsâand our CEO does the same thing. Itâs our little hub for tracking the health of the business. â Anthony Wakim Head of Finance at Kit â I love the ability to marry non-financial with financial data. All I have to do is create a database of it, and then I tell the drivers, âuse this as a databaseâ, and I can just put things together. Which is really cool. â Will Simon CFO at Mainspring â Iâm a huge fanboy. This is what Excel always should have been. â Jonathan Yantis CEO at QuicksortRx â We should have done this sooner. The compounding value of Runway over time will be tremendous, especially as we scale. In an instant, I can see how weâre doing today, and keep tabs on a few key metrics that stay up to date. â Traci Hirokawa Head of Business Ops â Iâve always been the gatekeeper of financial dataânot on purpose, but because of how things were set up. Now, making that data open, available, and easy to work with enables our team to make better decisions. â Darren Chu Head of BizOps & Strategy at Rootly â Weâre not planning in silos anymore. Everything is connectedâand that alignment makes us stronger as a team. â Cooper Lycan Founder at SoBet â Runway has been absolutely critical for understanding the business and where we're heading. â Andrew Maher Head of Finance â Runway transformed our finance operations. It wasn't just a change; it was a revolution, echoing Superhuman's commitment to innovation and efficiency. â Rebecca Egan Management Accountant at Tixel â Runway has sped up our modeling, improved clarity, and given us so much flexibility. We've gone from constantly juggling spreadsheets that would crash to using a system that can grow with us. It's a different world now. â Make finance your catalyst for growth Say goodbye to the constraints of traditional spreadsheets and hello to what modern financial modeling should look like.
