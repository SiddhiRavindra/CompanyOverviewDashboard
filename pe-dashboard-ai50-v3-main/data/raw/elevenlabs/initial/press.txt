As voice becomes a primary interface for using technology, we build AI that makes these interactions effortless and human. We began with ultra-realistic AI voices - clear, expressive, and multilingual. Today, we advance AI audio across speech, sound effects, and music, and turn that work into products people use every day. Through our Agents Platform and Creative Platform, teams deploy voice agents that listen, talk, and act, localize content at scale, tell stories, and improve accessibility. Our models speak over 70 languages and are used by businesses to run and scale in production, and by others to teach, support, connect, and create. Our aim is to make interacting with computers as natural as talking to a person - bringing the world’s knowledge, stories, and agents to life. Co-founders High school friends Mati and Piotr grew up together in Poland, often amused by the “rough” dubbing of American movies they watched. Years later, after building careers in technology, they were inspired to revisit this experience and set out to design a platform that could break down language barriers in content. Piotr Dąbkowski is the CTO of ElevenLabs. He formerly worked at Google. Mati Staniszewski is the CEO of ElevenLabs. He formerly worked at Palantir Technologies.
