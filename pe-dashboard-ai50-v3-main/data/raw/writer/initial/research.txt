See open roles Our approach Our team Our results Our approach Our approach is different: we believe that building large language models (LLMs) informed by enterprise requirements leads to AI systems that are more reliable, more controllable, and more transparent. When you ground cutting-edge AI innovation in real-life needs, it yields solutions that solve problems people actually face. Our team Our globally distributed team of AI/ML researchers and engineers has a five-year track record of groundbreaking research and development across language models, retrieval systems, and evaluations. Our results Our results demonstrate that when AI research starts with real needs, it leads to: Prioritizing capabilities that map to tangible outcomes Balanced focus between sophistication and practicality Better evaluation metrics to understand real-world performance Earlier identification of potential risks and failures Research highlights Read the blog Watch the video Read the blog Watch the talk Watch the video Research pillars Enterprise-optimized models Focus on developing more scalable, reliable, and transparent models specifically engineered for enterprise requirements Practical evaluations Development of model evaluation methodology that reflects real-world scenarios and risks Domain-specific specialization Research into applying AI systems in high-stakes industries Retrieval & knowledge integration Work on next-generation retrieval systems that safely and reliably connect language models with enterprise data All Enterprise-optimized models Practical evaluations Domain-specific specialization Retrieval Palmyra-mini: Small models, big throughput, powerful reasoning Enterprise-optimized models Sep 19, 2025 Reflect, retry, reward: Self-improving LLMs via reinforcement learning Practical evaluations Jun 12, 2025 Palmyra X5: The end of context constraints Enterprise-optimized models Apr 28, 2025 Expecting the unexpected: FailSafeQA Benchmark Practical evaluations, Domain-specific specialization Feb 10, 2025 Palmyra Creative: Unlocking creativity with AI Domain-specific specialization Dec 17, 2024 Introducing Self-evolving models Enterprise-optimized models Nov 20, 2024 Palmyra X4: Introducing actions Enterprise-optimized models Oct 9, 2024 Writing in the Margins Enterprise-optimized models Aug 27, 2024 Comparative analysis of retrieval systems in the real-world Retrieval May 3, 2024 OmniACT: A benchmark for enabling multimodal generalist autonomous agents Practical evaluations Feb 27, 2024 Fusion-in-decoder: achieving state-of-the-art open-domain QA performance Enterprise-optimized models Sep 13, 2023 Becoming self-instruct: Introducing early stopping criteria for minimal instruct tuning Enterprise-optimized models Jul 5, 2023 Palmyra Med: Instruction-based fine-tuning of LLMs enhancing medical domain performance Domain-specific specialization Jul 3, 2023 Palmyra Fin Domain-specific specialization Jul 3, 2023 Grammatical error correction: a survey of the state of the art Enterprise-optimized models Apr 29, 2023 No results found.
