LangChain Build agents faster, your way LangChain is an open source framework with a pre-built agent architecture and integrations for any model or tool â so you can build agents that adapt as fast as the ecosystem evolves. Get started Why use LangChain? Ship fast with proven agent patterns Build agents in minutes with templates for common use cases. create_agent provides a proven ReAct pattern on LangGraph's durable runtime. Open and neutral by design Swap models, tools, and databases without rewriting your application. With 1000+ integrations, you can future-proof your stack as AI advances, with no vendor lock-in. Customize without complexity Extend agent behavior through middleware without rewriting core logic. Add human-in-the-loop approval, compress long conversations, or remove sensitive dataâ all with simple, composable hooks. Durable runtime LangChain runs on LangGraphâs durable runtime â giving agents built-in persistence, rewind, checkpointing, and human-in-the-loop support.

LangChain is an open source framework with pre-built agent architectures and as integrations to models, tools, and databases to start building agents quickly. The LangChain framework integrates seamlessly with LangSmith, our platform for agent observability, evaluation, and deployment â you can set just one environment variable to get started. How is LangChain different from LangGraph? Use LangChain to get started quickly on simple use cases. Use LangGraph when you need to build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks. Â Â LangChain is often used to build standard agents like SQL queries and document analysis, customer support bots, and predictable linear workflows with minimal customization. Â Â LangGraph is often used for multi-agent research with specialized roles, long-running processes, use cases requiring human-in-the-loop approvals, and custom architectures with advanced control flow. â Can I use LangChain in production? Yes. Weâve released LangChain 1.0 , which means weâve committed to no breaking changes until 2.0. Companies like Rakuten, Cisco, and Moodyâs use LangChain in production for business-critical workflows. Ready to start shipping â¨reliable agents faster?
