We run your mission-critical workloads The world\u2019s most advanced AI organizations trust Lambda: Hyperscalers racing to build global AI infrastructure Enterprises deploying AI in regulated industries Frontier labs building trillion-parameter foundation models values.txt The goal of this document at Lambda is to answer the questions: Who gets hired? Rewarded? Promoted? Let go? What are the values and principles that have led to the success of Lambda and will continue to provide for its future success and prolonged existence? What company values will help Lambda succeed? It's important to have a set of long-lived and timeless values. We will start this value document with the most important thing we need to do: Obsess over the customer\n- . The output of the company is the output of the people working at the company. Thus, the qualities of the people working at the company determine the quality of its product, its culture, and its success. The road to success is simple: write down your goal, write down everything you need to accomplish it, and then execute against that goal every day and never give up. Build a team of brilliant people with an unstoppable culture You can't just have sheer brilliance. You need brilliance paired with an ability to work together as part of a team. Our job is to build a team of smart, unstoppable people working hard together towards the same ambitious goal. \"We're not just collecting talent; we're building a team.\" - Bill Belichick Write your thoughts down so that you can share them If you can't write your idea down into a one- or two-page document, you haven't thought about it enough.

Market Position\n. Be humble. Run an experiment and get immediate feedback from the market. Treating people at the company with respect, whoever they are. Move fast Usually, the only advantage that a small company has over a large company is speed. Make decisions quickly, execute quickly. Recognize when the decision can be reversed and when it cannot. If it's a reversible decision, then you can confidently make a decision quickly. No politics, no crypto 'No politics, no crypto' means that we don't discuss cryptocurrencies or politics at work. We think it's best to avoid holy wars, and there are plenty of other places where you can vigorously debate those topics online and in person.

A simple method of goal setting and execution from Brian Tracy. lambda ~ % Join the Lambda team \u2193 How we hire at Lambda We don\u2019t just hire great people \u2014 we hire the right people. 01 Pedigree isn\u2019t everything Your school or past company matters less than what you\u2019ve actually built, contributed, and impacted. 02 Your story > your timestamps Commitment is good, but smart moves matter too. We care about the why behind each step. 03 You can handle the chaos Fast-moving. High-change. Sometimes messy. You can create structure when there isn\u2019t any. 04 You\u2019re great at what you do We test for deep expertise, we\u2019re looking for field experts, and we don\u2019t compromise. 05 You fit our culture Skills alone won\u2019t cut it, you need to live our values. Care deeply about (y)our work, think like a hacker, be kind, obsess over our customers. 06 We\u2019re building a team built to win together\n\n## 8. Risk Factors\n- . Be prepared to talk about: projects you\u2019re proud of, how your skills fit the role, your work style, and your day-to-day team dynamics experience. STEP 03 Technical skills assessment (1-2 hours) Depending on the role, you may complete a skills-based assessment designed to give us a sense of how you work in practice. For engineering positions, this often includes live coding, take-home assignments, debugging, or system design tasks. For other roles, the assessment may look different and focus on the core skills needed to succeed in that area. STEP 04 Panel interviews (3\u20134+ hours) This stage brings you together with team members and cross-functional partners. You can expect a mix of technical discussions, problem-solving challenges, and behavioral or culture-fit questions. We want to understand how you collaborate, how you approach challenges, and how your values align with ours. We\u2019re looking for low-ego, resourceful hackers (in the most positive sense of the word)\n- .
