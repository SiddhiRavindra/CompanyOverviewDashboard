## Our core values

[Learn more](https://www.abridge.com/life-at-abridge)

01

### The obstacle is the way

We embrace challenges and transform constraints into unique solutions. Obstacles don’t deter us—we find a way to move around them, flowing like water.

02

### Choose action

We ship, learn, iterate, and empower each other to maintain momentum. We focus on reducing cycle time, working together to figure out how to do things better and faster. We work in a blameless culture, with a relentless pursuit for continuous improvement.

03

### Taste good things

We’re curious people and it makes sense—you have to taste good things to have good taste. As lifelong learners, we continuously seek knowledge and the ‘why’ behind the ‘what.’ We love nerding out.

04

### Help others win

We leave egos behind in pursuit of achieving success as a team. Success for us is a team sport and we use constructive feedback to help each other achieve growth.

05

### Honor humanity

We empathize with the needs of our users, accounting for their daily challenges and aspirations. We develop a deep understanding of how we can best serve them, earning and maintaining trust.
