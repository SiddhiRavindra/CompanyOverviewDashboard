- . This resulted in a better user experience for our customers." Kay Zhu | CTO at Genspark “Fireworks has been an amazing partner getting our Fast Apply and Copilot++ models running performantly. They exceeded other competitors we reviewed on performance. After testing their quantized model quality for our use cases, we have found minimal degradation. Fireworks helps implement task specific speed ups and new architectures, allowing us to achieve bleeding edge performance!” Sualeh Asif | CPO at Cursor "We've had a really great experience working with Fireworks to host open source models, including SDXL, Llama, and Mistral.
