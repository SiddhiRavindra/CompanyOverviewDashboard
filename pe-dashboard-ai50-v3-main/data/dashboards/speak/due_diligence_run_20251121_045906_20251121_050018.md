- . Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered tutor that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end.

Traction We've quickly grown to become the #1 English app in our first market, South Korea, and now serve hundreds of thousands of subscribers in over 30 countries Investment We've thoughtfully raised over $150m from leading institutions like Accel, OpenAI Startup Fund, and Founders Fund, and individual investors including Sam Altman, Peter Thiel, and Lachy Groom. People Team of 130 people across offices in San Francisco, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and Ljubljana, with backgrounds at companies like Meta, Google, Doordash, Block, and Dropbox

## 4. Product/Technology
. If you are looking to study or review or learn, this is an option, in addition to having a virtual tutor or a guide is made and the truth is excellent 👌10/10 mingorr81, 06/24/25 Better than anything else I took Spanish classes for seven years, I used Duolingo, I used Pimsleur, and others...yet I still struggled to speak and understand. this app is like having a personal tutor, without the anxiety of an actual person, judging your skills... This is the best language app I’ve ever used. User review, 07/21/23 Amazing!!! While other services just correct awkward sentences, I was surprised that Speak provides detailed feedback on 'why' the expression is awkward User Review, 06/04/24 If I knew now, what I knew them This app has the potential to be the best language learning app to date. Far surpasses, Babbel and Rosetta Stone. I will definitely be getting the premium package
