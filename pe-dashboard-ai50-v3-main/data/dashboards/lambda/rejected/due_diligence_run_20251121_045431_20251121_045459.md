## 3. Leadership
- . Our leadership combines deep ML experience with decades of building and scaling global infrastructure. We move fast, cut through noise, and prize clarity, trust, and technical excellence. We run your mission-critical workloads The world’s most advanced AI organizations trust Lambda: Hyperscalers racing to build global AI infrastructure Enterprises deploying AI in regulated industries Frontier labs building trillion-parameter foundation models values.txt The goal of this document at Lambda is to answer the questions: Who gets hired? Rewarded? Promoted? Let go? What are the values and principles that have led to the success of Lambda and will continue to provide for its future success and prolonged existence? What company values will help Lambda succeed? It's important to have a set of long-lived and timeless values. We will start this value document with the most important thing we need to do: Obsess over the customer
- . The output of the company is the output of the people working at the company. Thus, the qualities of the people working at the company determine the quality of its product, its culture, and its success. The road to success is simple: write down your goal, write down everything you need to accomplish it, and then execute against that goal every day and never give up. Build a team of brilliant people with an unstoppable culture You can't just have sheer brilliance. You need brilliance paired with an ability to work together as part of a team. Our job is to build a team of smart, unstoppable people working hard together towards the same ambitious goal. "We're not just collecting talent; we're building a team." - Bill Belichick Write your thoughts down so that you can share them If you can't write your idea down into a one- or two-page document, you haven't thought about it enough. Writing a one-pager is the first step to accomplishing any great task

## 5. Market Position
. Be humble. Run an experiment and get immediate feedback from the market. Treating people at the company with respect, whoever they are. Move fast Usually, the only advantage that a small company has over a large company is speed. Make decisions quickly, execute quickly. Recognize when the decision can be reversed and when it cannot. If it's a reversible decision, then you can confidently make a decision quickly. No politics, no crypto 'No politics, no crypto' means that we don't discuss cryptocurrencies or politics at work. We think it's best to avoid holy wars, and there are plenty of other places where you can vigorously debate those topics online and in person. Common quotes and idioms overheard at Lambda and what they mean: "Every problem is a people problem

## 7. Key Metrics
. A week, a month, and a year from now, you'll be absolutely staggered at the difference it makes. A simple method of goal setting and execution from Brian Tracy. lambda ~ % Join the Lambda team ↓ How we hire at Lambda We don’t just hire great people — we hire the right people. 01 Pedigree isn’t everything Your school or past company matters less than what you’ve actually built, contributed, and impacted. 02 Your story > your timestamps Commitment is good, but smart moves matter too. We care about the why behind each step. 03 You can handle the chaos Fast-moving. High-change. Sometimes messy. You can create structure when there isn’t any. 04 You’re great at what you do We test for deep expertise, we’re looking for field experts, and we don’t compromise. 05 You fit our culture Skills alone won’t cut it, you need to live our values. Care deeply about (y)our work, think like a hacker, be kind, obsess over our customers. 06 We’re building a team built to win together

## 8. Risk Factors
- . Be prepared to talk about: projects you’re proud of, how your skills fit the role, your work style, and your day-to-day team dynamics experience. STEP 03 Technical skills assessment (1-2 hours) Depending on the role, you may complete a skills-based assessment designed to give us a sense of how you work in practice. For engineering positions, this often includes live coding, take-home assignments, debugging, or system design tasks. For other roles, the assessment may look different and focus on the core skills needed to succeed in that area. STEP 04 Panel interviews (3–4+ hours) This stage brings you together with team members and cross-functional partners. You can expect a mix of technical discussions, problem-solving challenges, and behavioral or culture-fit questions. We want to understand how you collaborate, how you approach challenges, and how your values align with ours. We’re looking for low-ego, resourceful hackers (in the most positive sense of the word)
