## 1. Company Overview
About Runway / Simulate any business decision in seconds Webinar Â How we turned hot sauce into a viral marketing campaign Skip to Main Content Book a demo B G2.com 4.8/5 stars We empower teams to build great companies by making business understandable and accessible to everyone Our story 01 2007 Why do we care so much? Hi! I'm Siqi, one of the founders of Runway. I was 23 when I started running my first company: Serious Business. Every month, I got these spreadsheets in my inbox from a Harvard MBA on my team that I didn't really understand. But that's okayâthat's what âbusiness peopleâ are for right? Finance has always made me feel insecure Even as a 4-time CEO and 3-time founder, I've always been insecure about my understanding of the business side of things.I didn't think of myself as a âbusiness person.â I didn't even know what contribution margin meant until I was responsible for the metric at Postmates

## 2. Funding History
- . Why hasn't dealing with financials in a company changed at all? In a world where Figma and Notion exist, that seems like an opportunity. And so we started Runway. Getting off the ground And so we got started right in the middle of the pandemic. Luckily, we found some incredible people who believed in our mission, including Garry Tan (YC & Initialized), a16z, Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Dylan Field (founder of Figma), Eric Ries, Claire Hughes Johnson (COO of Stripe), Henry Ward (founder of Carta), Akshay Kothari (COO of Notion), Eugene Wei, Lenny Rachitsky, Nikita Bier, Scott Belsky, Soleio Cuervo, Balaji Srinivasan, and many others. Encountering turbulence It wasn't all smooth sailing from there. It took us a long time to deeply understand the problems facing finance owners and business operators today, and invent new solutions to these problems that are powerful, flexible, and accessible

It took us a long time to deeply understand the problems facing finance owners and business operators today, and invent new solutions to these problems that are powerful, flexible, and accessible. To get off the ground, we had to rebuild a good chunk of Excel, invent new abstractions that connect your business intent with numbers for the first time, and integrate with hundreds of sources of data within enterprises
